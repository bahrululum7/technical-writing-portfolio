# 📚 Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m an aspiring **Technical Writer** focused on creating clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation for technical tools, workflows, and software.

This repository is a showcase of my learning journey using the **Docs-as-Code** approach, with tools like **Markdown**, **MkDocs**, and **GitHub**.

## ✨ About Me

I am currently learning and practicing technical writing using:

- ✍️ Markdown
- 🔧 MkDocs (Material for MkDocs theme)
- 🌿 Git & GitHub
- 🧱 Docs-as-Code principles
- 📘 English-language documentation

Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate how I structure documentation, organize content, and communicate technical concepts effectively.
