# 📚 Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m an aspiring **Technical Writer** dedicated to crafting clear, user-focused, and developer-friendly documentation for modern software, APIs, and technical workflows.

This repository highlights my hands-on learning journey using the **Docs-as-Code** approach with tools like **Markdown**, **MkDocs**, and **GitHub**.

---

## ✨ About Me

I am currently building my skills in technical writing through real-world examples and self-driven projects, using:

- ✍️ Markdown for structured content
- 🔧 MkDocs (Material for MkDocs theme) for site generation
- 🌿 Git & GitHub for version control
- 🧱 Docs-as-Code workflows
- 📘 English-language documentation writing
- 📡 REST API Documentation (with Postman & dummy APIs)

This portfolio demonstrates how I structure technical documentation, explain API behavior, and organize content with clarity and consistency.
