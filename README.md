# 📚 Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m an aspiring **Technical Writer** focused on creating clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation for technical tools, workflows, and software.

This repository is a showcase of my learning journey using the **Docs-as-Code** approach, with tools like **Markdown**, **MkDocs**, and **GitHub**.
