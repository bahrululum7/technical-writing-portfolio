# Advanced Usage of MkDocs
Once youâ€™re done writing and previewing your documentation, MkDocs allows you to build a static site. This site can be hosted on any web server or deployed to services like GitHub Pages.

MkDocs also supports customizing themes, navigation, plugins, and other settings using the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.

## Build the Site and Explore the Structure
    1. Open your terminal or CMD.
    2. Navigate to your MkDocs project folder.
    3. Run the following command to build the site:
       mkdocs build

    4. MkDocs will generate a folder named site/. This folder contains all the HTML, JS, and CSS files.

    5. Open index.html inside the site/ folder with a browser to preview the static site locally.
